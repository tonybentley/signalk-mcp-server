  "tools": {
    "signalk:get_vessel_state": {
      "purpose": "Get comprehensive vessel data snapshot",
      "returns": "Current values for all available paths",
      "response_format": "Object with path keys and value/timestamp objects",
      "use_when": "Need complete vessel status overview",
      "frequency": "Use sparingly - data intensive operation",
      "efficiency_note": "Contains hundreds of data points - cache results"
    },
    "signalk:get_ais_targets": {
      "purpose": "Get nearby vessel traffic information", 
      "returns": "Array of AIS contacts with positions and vessel details",
      "response_format": "Array of vessel objects with MMSI, position, course, speed",
      "use_when": "Traffic analysis, collision avoidance, situational awareness",
      "frequency": "Can call frequently - AIS updates every few seconds",
      "efficiency_note": "Updates continuously - good for real-time awareness"
    },
    "signalk:get_active_alarms": {
      "purpose": "Get current system alerts and notifications",
      "returns": "Active alarms with severity levels and messages",
      "response_format": "Array of alarm objects with path, state, message",
      "use_when": "System health checks, troubleshooting issues",
      "frequency": "Check when concerned about system status",
      "efficiency_note": "Typically small dataset unless problems exist"
    },
    "signalk:list_available_paths": {
      "purpose": "Discover what data is available on this vessel",
      "returns": "List of all SignalK paths currently providing data",
      "response_format": "Object with paths array and count",
      "use_when": "System discovery, understanding vessel capabilities",
      "frequency": "Rarely - vessel capabilities don't change often",
      "efficiency_note": "Capabilities are relatively static"
    },
    "signalk:get_path_value": {
      "purpose": "Get current value for a specific SignalK path",
      "parameters": {
        "path": "Specific SignalK path to query (e.g., 'navigation.position')"
      },
      "returns": "Current value and timestamp for the specified path",
      "response_format": "Single value with timestamp",
      "use_when": "Need specific current value without full vessel state",
      "frequency": "Good for targeted queries - much more efficient than full state",
      "efficiency_note": "Highly efficient for single data points"
    },
    "signalk:get_connection_status": {
      "purpose": "Check SignalK server connectivity and health",
      "returns": "Connection status, server info, basic statistics",
      "response_format": "Object with connection details and server metadata",
      "use_when": "Troubleshooting connectivity issues, system diagnostics",
      "frequency": "As needed for diagnostics",
      "efficiency_note": "Lightweight operation"
    }
  },
  "usage_patterns": {
    "initial_discovery": [
      "get_connection_status() - verify connectivity",

    ],
    "ongoing_monitoring": [
      "get_path_value() for specific updates",
      "get_ais_targets() for traffic awareness",
      "get_active_alarms() when needed"

    "troubleshooting": [
      "get_connection_status() - check connectivity",
      "get_active_alarms() - identify issues",

  "efficiency_guidelines": {
    "avoid_repetition": "Don't call get_vessel_state() multiple times in same conversation",
    "cache_results": "Remember data from previous tool calls within conversation",
    "targeted_queries": "Use get_path_value() for specific data instead of full state",
    "batch_analysis": "Analyze multiple aspects from single get_vessel_state() call",
    "path_categorization": "Group related paths when analyzing data"
  },
  "data_interpretation": {
    "units": "All SignalK values use SI units (meters, seconds, Kelvin, radians)",
    "timestamps": "All data includes RFC 3339 timestamps for freshness checking",
    "missing_data": "Paths may not exist if sensors/systems not installed",
    "multiple_sources": "Same data may come from multiple devices",
    "null_values": "Null values indicate sensor offline or no valid reading"
